# anomalies_detection
This project employs Machine Learning techniques to search for outlier galaxies within a multidimensional parameter space, aiming to establish connections between these anomalies and their underlying astrophysical and cosmological parameters. 

The galaxy catalogs we used to train, validate, and test our models come from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations â€“ CAMELS project - comprehending different setups of hydrodynamical simulations.
