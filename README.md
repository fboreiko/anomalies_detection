# anomalies_detection
This project employs Machine Learning techniques to search for outlier galaxies within a multidimensional parameter space, aiming to establish connections between these anomalies and their underlying astrophysical and cosmological parameters. Through this exploration, we not only contribute to anomaly detection but also offer insights that can refine existing models, potentially advancing our comprehension of the universe's formation and evolution processes.

The galaxy catalogs we used to train, validate, and test our models come from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations â€“ CAMELS project - comprehending different setups of hydrodynamical simulations.
