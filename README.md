# anomalies_detection
Normalizing Flows implementation aimed at searching for outlier galaxies within a multidimensional parameter space, with a goal to establish connections between these anomalies and their underlying astrophysical and cosmological parameters. 

The galaxy catalogs used to train, validate, and test our models come from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations â€“ CAMELS project - comprehending different setups of hydrodynamical simulations.
